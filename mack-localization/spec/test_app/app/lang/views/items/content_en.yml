:content: "With gas prices as high as they currently are many Americans are looking for ways to cut their automobile gas prices and make them a little more budget friendly. Here are some tips that I am currently using to help make my gas just a little bit cheaper.

Store Grocery Cards

Many stores such as Kroger have store discount cards. Many of these stores offers a certain percentage of money off per gallon or free gas depending on how much you spend during the previous month. For instance if I shop at Kroger and spend $150 in November then come December I will receive .10 off per gallon of gas I pump on my first four visits. If the amount you spend is more than $150 then the amount off per gallon also increases for instance $350 spent gets you .20 off a gallon, $550 gets you .30 per gallon and anything over $750 a month and you receive .50 off per gallon. The key to using this to your advantage is to fill up your tank for the first four fill ups you use that month, since the discount only applies the first four times. Even if you do not shop at Kroger you can still save .03 a gallon just buy using their store card and gas station. If you don't have a Kroger in your area check with your local grocery store to see what promotions they run.

Speedway Speedy Rewards Card

Speedway gas station is a nation wide chain that offers a discount card too. These cards are just like the ones you use for the grocery store or CVS bonus cards. They are free to get and can be picked up at any Speedway location. This card offers you free products once you earn so many points. You can get anything from a free Coca-Cola to money off your next fill up of even earn gift cards. Although the discount does not apply right then, you can earn points to save you on gas later. Another great program that Speedway runs often is the $1 off any $25 Speedway gift card purchase. This means that you pay $24 for a $25 gift card. So what we do every week is run in to Speedway, using my Speedy Rewards card I purchase a $25 gift card for $24, earn points for my purchase and then turn around and use the gift card on my gas. This saves me a $1 each time and I earn points towards free things. I know it's not a huge savings but it does add up.

Get gas in the middle of the week

Gas prices are always higher on the weekends and during holiday weeks. The gas company's know that people are doing more traveling during these times and the demand for gas is higher so they increase the price. Filling up on a Tuesday or Wednesday as opposed to filling up on Friday or Sunday will save you anywhere from .03 to even as high as .15 a gallon. If you know your going somewhere for the up coming weekend fill up sooner. If you will need gas again by the weekend invest in a gas can or two, fill them up and store them in your garage. They will be there come the weekend when gas prices have jumped back up.

Car Pool

Car Pooling is one of the best ways to save on gas. If you have a co-worker who lives close to you offer to car pool with them. Or maybe your child has a friend who lives near by that attends the same school, offer to trade off with the other child's parents for taking the kids to school. If your heading the same way as someone else why not only pay for gas for the one trip instead of both people paying for it? Not only will it help your pocket book but it's good for the environment.

While these tips and tricks may not save you a huge amount at this point with gas prices anywhere from $3 to $4+ depending on where you live, every little bit helps along the way."
